# mailnag-gnome-shell

Mailnag gnome-shell extension.
This extension requires the Mailnag daemon from the [mailnag-next](https://github.com/pulb/mailnag/tree/mailnag-next) branch.

#### Features:
* Currently the extension only shows a notification source in the messaging tray (including counter badge).
* In the future the extension should also display an icon with a drop down mail list in the top panel.

Help is very appreciated!

To install the extension just copy it to ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions and enable it in gnome-tweak-tool.
